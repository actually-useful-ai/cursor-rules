# Code Snippet Review Rule

When reviewing code snippets or replacing one implementation with another from an example, follow these guidelines to ensure comprehensive analysis and accurate implementation:

## 1. Review Full File Context

- Thoroughly examine the **entire file(s)** rather than relying on isolated snippets
- Identify all relevant sections and understand the overall structure of the code
- Consider how the file fits into the broader project architecture

## 2. Identify Precise Modification Points

- Accurately determine which specific part of the file needs to be replaced or modified
- Ensure you are targeting the exact location requiring updates
- Understand the scope and boundaries of the required changes

## 3. Apply Examples With Precision

- When replacing a non-functional implementation, verify you're using the correct and complete implementation from the example
- Avoid reintroducing outdated or incorrect versions of code
- Maintain all functional aspects of the provided example

## 4. Preserve Context and Integrity

- Ensure the updated code integrates seamlessly with the rest of the file
- Do not remove or alter unrelated content unless necessary for proper integration
- Maintain the original style, formatting, and naming conventions

## 5. Seek Clarification When Needed

- If any part of the request or file context is unclear, ask for clarification rather than making assumptions
- Confirm that your implementation meets the intended functional requirements
- Verify any edge cases or potential issues before finalizing changes

By adhering to these steps, you ensure thorough file review and precise, accurate updates that avoid introducing errors or regressions.
